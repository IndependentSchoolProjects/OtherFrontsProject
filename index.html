            <h3>How was Palestine Involved in World War 1?</h3>
            <p>
                During the First World War, Palestine was under Ottoman rule. However, the British were keenly interested in it and requested it in the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. This territory was greatly useful to the British for two main reasons. Firstly, it would secure the Suez Canal from land invasions, suxh as the Ottoman one at the start of the war. Secondly, Palestine is located in a key region between Europe, Africa, and Asia. British control over the region would guaruntee Britain's overseas holdings, especially India.
